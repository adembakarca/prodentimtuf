          <h2>September 2023 - New Scientific Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            A recent study put out in the Springer Nature publication found that
            people who have good teeth have a high population of good bacteria
            in the mouth.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #d54545">
            (Hint - No Toothpaste or Mouthwash Involved)
          </p>
          <p>
            As it turns out, many common dental products (such as toothpaste and
            mouthwash) contain toxic ingredients that can destroy the microbiome
            in the mouth. This explains why teeth can thrive for hundreds of
            years outside the mouth (in fossils), while in our mouth they get
            ruined by something so simple as chocolate.

            <a href="index.html" style="color: black"> ProDentim </a> is a healthy
            natural formula made especially for the oral and dental health. It
            has 3.5 billion strains of probiotic and friendly bacteria that help
            keep a healthy balance of oral solution in your mouth. It also has
            natural ingredients like mint, which is known to help freshen breath
            and whiten teeth. Clinical studies have been done on the ingredients
            and have shown that they work well. <br /><br />
            This supplement is a one-of-a-kind mix of vitamins, minerals, and
            bacteria. It has been shown to improve the health of the teeth and
            gums in clinical tests. Also, the product's unique mix of nutrients
            and probiotic CS can help restore the balance of the microbes in the
            mouth, making sure that the breath is fresh and healthy. It is made
            from plant-based ingredients that fight bad bacteria and helps keep
            your teeth healthy.
            <br /><br />
            ProDentim is a natural plant-based supplement containing vitamins,
            minerals, probiotics, and other ingredients. These ingredients come
            from reliable sources and are mixed in a way approved by clinical
            trials to ensure they work as well as possible.
            <br /><br />
            A study from 2020 shows that using probiotics to treat oral
            infections might help protect against oral bacteria. Researchers
            have looked at how probiotics affect the microbiota in the gut and
            how they help the immune system. But with ProDentim, these
            supplements are the best way to keep your immune system healthy.
            Insulin is also in ProDentim. Insulin is a type of sugar that is
            found in a lot of digestive health supplements.
            <br /><br />
            Prodentim adds good bacteria to your mouth, and the probiotics in
            ProDentim help prevent cavities. They help eliminate bad bacteria in
            your mouth, keeping your teeth and gums from worsening. ProDentim
            also helps you keep your mouth's pH level healthy, which keeps gum
            disease and bad breath at bay. And the good bacteria in ProDentim
            help your immune system by building it up. Your mouth will be better
            able to fight off infections if you do this.
            <br /><br />
            Gingivitis can be treated by taking care of your teeth and gums, but
            ProDentim helps keep your teeth healthy. ProDentim strengthens your
            gums and stops the bacteria that makes your teeth look yellow.

              >ProDentim Supplement: Is it Safe and Protected?</span
            ><br /><br />
            ProDentim is a supplement designed to improve oral health. It has no
            negative side effects. The sole disadvantage is that it cannot be
            purchased through online markets or applications such as Amazon. It
            is also not available offline.
            <br /><br />
            If ProDentim is not available on its official website now, you must
            wait for it to come back in the online store. Furthermore, the
            supplement is certain to produce excellent benefits, but it may be
            too soon for some and too late for others. So be patient and
            continue to experiment with the tablets for the greatest outcomes.
            <br /><br />
            ProDentim magic supplementation is not advised for pregnant or
            breastfeeding women. Taking supplements at these times might be
            risky because they may be damaging to the mother's and unborn
            child's health.
            <br /><br />
            These women must have a prescription for any dietary supplements.
            You are not required to try anything that may be damaging to your
            health. Discuss your choices with your doctor before using any
            alternative, such as a ProDentim supplement.

              >Brain Behind ProDentim</span
            ><br /><br />
            Prodentim’s Inventor Dr. Drew Sutton has been an otolaryngologist
            for more than 30 years and is board certified in the field. He went
            to the University of Rochester and got a degree in General Surgery.
            He then did an internship in that field. Dr. Drew has a lot of
            experience helping people with different oral health problems, such
            as gum disease, but not just that.
            <br /><br />
            The idea for the nutritional supplement ProDentim came from Dr. Drew
            Sutton. He worked hard for several months before he came up with the
            best way to make the nutritional supplement. Since he has so many
            certifications in oral health, you can be sure that he knows a lot
            about it. Dr. Sutton has helped a huge number of people improve
            their dental health over the course of his career.
            <br /><br />
            It was not easy for him to put together all of the information he
            had learned over the years and find a group of researchers to help

          is a commonly used ingredient in a wide range of oral care products.
          Its active component, menthol, has the ability to stimulate the nerves
          in your mouth. These nerves transmit signals to the brain, triggering
          a reflex that can induce vomiting followed by swallowing. This reflex,
          in turn, activates the muscles surrounding the mouth and promotes
          saliva production. The accumulation of plaque in the area between your
          teeth and gums can contribute to the onset of gum disease. If this
          plaque is not effectively removed, it can progressively harden and
          eventually form tartar, which is a precursor to periodontal disease.

                <strong> Stops plaque from building up : </strong> ProDentim
                stops plaque from building up. The probiotic bacteria in the
                mouth are the first step in absorbing nutrients from other
                foods. The immune system and other parts of the body are helped
                by a mix of these strains, which are found in prebiotic
                supplements. They work to get rid of the bad microorganisms that
                cause tooth decay, gum disease, and gums that pull away from the
                teeth. ProDentim is an oral supplement that has a lot of good
                microorganisms that fight plaque and bad breath and make gums
                healthier. One of its most important parts is a strain of
                bacteria called B.Lactis BL-04, which has been studied a lot in
                the past few years. This strain helps the immune system work
                better, keeps the digestive system in check, and keeps people
                from getting diabetes. It also helps the immune system and
                promotes the growth of healthy bacteria. It is also thought to
                help keep strep throat and tonsillitis at bay.

                <strong>Cuts down on mouth breath :</strong>
                ProDentim helps to make your breath fresh. Whether you're a
                teenager or in your 40s, you probably know that mouth breathing
                is bad for your health. People actually breathe through their
                mouths for some very good reasons. From allergies to underlying
                breathing problems, breathing through the mouth can cause
                serious health problems. Most of the time, the problem can be
                avoided, but mouth breathing can be treated. Using the nose to
                breathe is good for the body. The air you take in through your
                nose is warm and moist, which makes it much easier for your
                lungs to work right. Second, breathing through your mouth is bad
                for your gums, tongue, and tissues. This habit can make your
                teeth and gums sick. The shape of your nose is another reason
                why you breathe through your mouth. Mouth breathing might be a
                natural way to deal with pain.

                <strong> Eliminates gingivitis: </strong>
                ProDentim is a good oral health supplement that you don't need
                to look any further for. This product has a mix of probiotics,
                like Lactobacillus reuteri, which help control inflammation and
                keep the mouth healthy. BL-04, which is a type of
                Bifidobacterium lactis, also helps keep your mouth and lungs
                healthy and your immune system strong. It also has spearmint,
                which keeps your breath fresh and helps reduce swelling. This
                supplement has natural ingredients and 3.5 billion strains of
                probiotics that are known to be good for dental health.
                Peppermint is in ProDentim, and it helps freshen breath and
                whiten teeth. Another natural part of the supplement is malic
                acid. It helps keep the microbiome healthy and keeps the number
                of bad bacteria in the mouth in check. Strawberries and other
                fruits are used to make these ingredients. Some probiotic
                supplements also have inulin, which is found in ProDentim.

                <strong> Lessening of inflammation in the mouth : </strong>
                ProDentim is a natural supplement that has been getting more and
                more popular over the past few weeks. The company that makes it
                says that its special mix of probiotics and plant-based
                ingredients is meant to help restore healthy bacteria and keep
                the mouth from being too sensitive. By restoring the balance of
                good bacteria in the mouth and making the pH level more stable,
                ProDentim is able to fight inflammation and bring back a healthy
                mouth. It also gets rid of bad breath and lessens the smell of
                gum disease. Dicalcium phosphate is the main thing that makes up
                ProDentim. Dicalcium phosphate is good for your teeth and can
                stop a number of dental problems from happening. Researchers
                also found that peppermint might help fight inflammation in the
                mouth. Peppermint also has chemicals in it that are naturally
                antibacterial. This means that it can fight infections well and
                help keep gums healthy. Peppermint is good for your teeth and
                gums, according to the National Center for Biotechnology
                Information.

                    ProDentim is the best. I will tell you why this is the only
                    supplement for your teeth that works. Other treatments might
                    help quickly, but only for a short time. On the other hand,
                    this product will keep working because it kills the bacteria
                    instead of covering them up. If you take one in the morning,
                    your sensitive teeth and bad breath will get better. This is
                    something I'll always buy. I wish I had known about this
                    years ago so I wouldn't have been embarrassed by my bad
                    breath and tooth and gum pain that keeps coming back.

                    I've never seen a better product for keeping your teeth
                    clean than this one. Since I was often given antibiotics as
                    a child, many good microorganisms in my body died. With this
                    product, the result was seen right away. It's amazing how
                    long the taste of freshness stays in my mouth. I'm very
                    thankful to the people who made this product because they
                    are helping to restore people's oral flora and make our gums
                    and teeth stronger, whiter, and healthier.

                    ProDentim gives my life a new meaning. Since I was in high
                    school, I've always had really bad breath. Students at my
                    school began to leave me out of group activities and
                    meetings. I learned about ProDentim at that time. I've
                    noticed the difference in how my mouth tastes. No bad
                    smells, and even after eating, my gums are healthier than
                    they used to be. By the way, what a bonus! I can now even go
                    on dates. I am now an active member of my school groups
                    because of ProDentim.

                When taken every day, the ProDentim Dental Care Formula capsules
                can help with major dental health problems. This method stops
                constant bleeding, pain, and swelling. It also makes it less
                likely that you will get an infection in your teeth or gums. The

                It works best if you use it for at least three to six months.
                This will make sure you get where you want to go. It can be
                bought once a month, but we recommend buying 3 to 6 bottles
                because we offer discounts and that's the least amount you need
                to see results. You should know that you can't get this discount
                all year long. So use it up while you still can.

                If you live in the United States or Canada, you can expect your
                order to be shipped within 5–7 business days. Orders from places
                other than the US or Canada usually take between 8 and 15
                business days, plus the time it takes to clear customs. Because
                of the Covid-19 pandemic, delivery times may be changed. We will
                send your order to your office or home using a premium carrier
                like FedEx or UPS.

                  Health?
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                ProDentim’s researchers think that probiotics might help keep
                dental plaque from building up. This is because acid lactic is
                made by living microorganisms when they digest food. In this
                way, the acids make chemicals like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide
                less dangerous. They are made when bacterial cells multiply.
                Another reason could be that probiotics stop other bacteria that
                can cause tooth decay from growing. For example, Streptococcus
                mutagens, which can cause tooth decay, can't grow when
                Lactobacillus is around.
